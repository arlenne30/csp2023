  <p><em>My name is Arlenne Serrano, In my Senior year at Santa Ana High School. I have taken a IntroEngrDePLTW class my Freshman year and Im currently taking a Arts/Graphic class. A reason why Im taking this class is because I was placed here. My Personal Intrest I would say is piercing people. I've pierced my family ears and some friends nose piercings. </em></p>
